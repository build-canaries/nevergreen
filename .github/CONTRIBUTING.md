## Contribution guidelines

Firstly, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :heart:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Nevergreen.

#### Design decisions

Nevergreen should be able to run completely stand alone, so it can be used on an internal network that have no 
access to the external internet. This is why we include all resources such as JavaScript and fonts instead of 
pulling them from CDNs.

We do not maintain older versions of Nevergreen, we always roll new features, improvements and bug fixes (if they 
still exist!) into newer versions of Nevergreen. If for some reason you can't or don't want to update to a newer version, 
then you'll need to fork and make the changes yourself. Feel free to jump onto chat if you'd like some advice from the 
team.

We assume our users are very technical and have control over the environment Nevergreen is running on. For this reason 
we only aim to support the newest versions of the most popular browsers, under the assumption these can be installed and 
kept up to date.

#### Reporting bugs

* Check the bug was not already reported by searching [existing issues](https://github.com/build-canaries/nevergreen/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new issue](https://github.com/build-canaries/nevergreen/issues/new).

#### Requesting new features

* [Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/build-canaries/nevergreen/issues/new) with your idea or change.

#### Submitting patches

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch, including the relevant issue number if applicable. If not just add 
any relevant information directly to the PR, no need to create an issue first.

Make sure you include tests for your changes!
