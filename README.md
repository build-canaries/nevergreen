# Nevergreen

Nevergreen is a build monitor with attitude. It has two distinct features that set it apart:

* Your builds should always be green. Nevergreen understands this and only shows you jobs that have failed or are building.
* Nevergreen uses HTML localStorage. So the config is stored in your web browser. You only need to run it once to host hundreds of different build monitors.

Get started by visiting [nevergreen.io](https://nevergreen.io) or [run it locally](https://github.com/build-canaries/nevergreen/wiki/running-locally)!
