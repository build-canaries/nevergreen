# Nevergreen

Nevergreen is a build monitor with attitude. It is awesome for two reasons:

* Your builds should always be green. Nevergreen understands this and only shows you jobs that have failed or are building.
* Nevergreen uses HTML localStorage. So the config is stored in your web browser. You only need to run it once to host hundreds of different build monitors.

Check out the demo at [http://nevergreen.io](http://nevergreen.io).
