# Nevergreen

Nevergreen is a build monitor with attitude. Continually deliver via fast clear feedback.

-   Your builds should always be green. Nevergreen understands this and only shows you projects that have failed or are building
-   Nevergreen uses your local browser to store configuration. You only need to run it once to host different build monitors for every team
-   Nevergreen is fully responsive, it'll look just as good full screen or sharing the space with other dashboards
-   You can track as many CI servers as you like, allowing you to easily track dependent builds from other teams
